This directory contains the Makefile to build the app.zip package.

Make sure you have the GNU Mtools https://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/ available
to build the .ST floppy disk images.

It supposes the ATARI programs and the ce_main_app are built.
To do so, use "make atari_progs" on a PC with cross compiler to build
the ATARI programs, and build both cosmosex_yocto and cosmosex_raspbian
on a RPi.
The cosmosex_* main app should be put in ce_main_app directory.

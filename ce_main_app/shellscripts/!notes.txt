New style: 
Just copy the files in app.zip/shellscripts so we don't have to extract these separatelly. 


Old style:
1. take all the *.sh and other files you want to update on device
2. zip those files to newscripts.zip
3. xxd -i newscripts.zip > newscripts_zip.h
4. copy that newscripts_zip.h file to project

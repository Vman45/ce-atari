Building:
compile with flags: -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage  (already done in makefile)
link    with flags: -lgcov                          (already done in makefile)

makefile has been modified to not use obj/ subdir to make the usage of lcov easier.
Without that modification it should be possible, but you should pass some args to lcov to do that.


Using:

1) build the app with compiler and linker flags: make clean ; make

2) clear the counters of tests runned by running:
lcov --directory . --zerocounters

3) run the tests (even multiple times) by running the app with the right args:
./cosmosex_onpc run-tests (not implemented yet)

4) process the coverage report:
lcov --no-external --base-directory . --directory . --capture --output-file ce.info

5) generate the html report and simple report by running:
genhtml -o /tmp/ce-coverage/ ce.info
